# ML / AI Portfolio

## Objectives
This portfolio showcases my work in **Machine Learning (ML)** and **Generative AI (GenAI)**, demonstrating both knowledge of supervised machine learning and modern LLM-based AI applications.

## Learning Goals
- Use supervised learning methods for predictive modeling and business decision-making.
- Understand and implement deep learning models, including large language models (LLMs).  
- Explore Retrieval-Augmented Generation systems for document-based AI solutions.  
- Learn best practices for data preprocessing, embeddings, vector search, and prompt design.  

## Portfolio Structure
- **Classification/**  
  Contains a supervised machine learning model to predict customer churn and evaluate different classification approaches.

- **GenAI/**  
  Projects using generative AI and LLMs. *(To be developed)*

## Next Steps / Improvements
- Start the GenAI project.  
- Apply MLOps workflows to the Gen AI project.
